# Experimental Details

## Qualitative Analysis

Here, I provide qualitative analysis of the generated images in "Example Generated Images" section in `README.md`.

The exact prompts used in these examples are provided in **Appendix B**.

### Example 1: "Gigantic Mona Lisa Attacks the City"

This example illustrates a successful case of the proposed method (DAS-AG and DAS-rAG). The result of DAS-rAG is more detailedâ€” for example, both the clothing textures of the person in the front and the back-standing Mona Lisa are more refined. Additionally, the perspective appears more accurate. In contrast, the result of DAS-rAG is more ambiguous and cheap-looking compared to the baseline method (DAS). These features are also reflected in the aesthetic score, resulting in a higher score for DAS-AG and a lower score for DAS-rAG.

### Example 2: "Japanese Geisha Girl"

This example also illustrates a successful case of the proposed method (DAS-AG and DAS-rAG).
In the result of the baseline method, the facial features are misaligned, with numerous artifacts.
However, in the result of DAS-AG, the facial features are arranged more accurately, though not perfectly. Additionally, the large water droplet in the lower left appears more photorealistic.

Another notable difference is that DAS-AG chooses an open eye instead of a closed one.
This may suggest that the aesthetic model reflects human preferences for photogenic images, influenced by the human-voted labels in the training dataset.

In contrast, the result of DAS-rAG produces an almost unrecognizable face, with fewer visually interesting elements in the image.

### Example 3: "Gamma-ray Bursts Over Tokyo Tower"

This example highlights a failure case of DAS-AG, where its aesthetic score (3.62) is lower than that of DAS (3.80).

Looking at the generated image, though the cloud details become more fine-grained in DAS-AG, the central tower, which stands out in the baseline method (DAS), disappears (or is pushed far into the background), which may have affected the aesthetic score of the evaluation model.

This could be due to either overfitting to the aesthetic prediction model used during generation,
or a difference in preference between the evaluation model and the generation model, given the inherent ambiguity of "aesthetics".

The result of DAS-rAG successfully deteriorates the aesthetic quality of the generated image, where the texture details in the front tower are diminished, and the cloud formations become more vague, making them almost unrecognizable.

The aesthetic score also reflects this visual degradation, resulting in the lower score of 3.00 compared to DAS's 3.80.
